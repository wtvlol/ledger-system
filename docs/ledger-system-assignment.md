# Internal Ledger System – Take-Home Assignment

---

## Overview

Build a simple financial ledger system that records account transactions and maintains accurate balances.

**Time Guidance:** You can spend up to 2 days.

---

## Functional Requirements

1. **Record Transactions**
   - POST `/transactions` with: source account, destination account, amount
   - Transaction is recorded atomically (both accounts updated together, or neither)
   - Returns transaction ID and confirmation

2. **Query Balance**
   - GET `/accounts/{id}` returns current balance
   - GET `/accounts/{id}/transactions` returns transaction history (ordered by timestamp)

3. **Transfer Money**
   - Money moves from source to destination in a single atomic operation
   - Source balance decreases, destination increases by same amount
   - If source has insufficient balance, reject the transfer

---

## System Behaviour

- Transactions can be reversed (posted as a reversal/correction transaction)
- Prevents duplicate transactions when the same request is resubmitted
- Verifies that total money in the ledger matches the expected sum and reports any discrepancies
- Handles transactions between accounts in different currencies using exchange rates
- The system safely processes multiple simultaneous transfers to the same account without losing updates or creating inconsistencies
- At month-end, accounts are reconciled against transaction history, verifying balances and detecting discrepancies

## Notes for Candidates

- **AI is encouraged** for boilerplate, API setup, and exploration
- Focus your effort on correctness and clarity, not fancy UI
- Document any assumptions about the ledger's behavior
- If you extend beyond core, briefly explain your design choices/tradeoffs
